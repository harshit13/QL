# Q Learning
Training some RL algo

## 1) Simple QL Algo [https://github.com/harshit13/QL/tree/master/SimpleQL]
- This is a kick start for beginner. A fixed (small) state space is used \[MxN grid\].
- Agent is trined with Q-values via epsilon greedy approach.

## 2) Copter QL Algo [https://github.com/harshit13/QL/tree/master/CopterQL]
- This is an attempt to help agent learn to play a Copter Game, via reinforcement learning.
- A copter game is designed using OOP techniques and Pygame API (user can use key board strokes to play the game.
- An agent is trained using state space approximation using Deepmind's update delay and experience replay.
- A feed-forward NN architecture is designed to learn the state space.
